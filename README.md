# Data Science
I apply ML algorithms on public data. Source data is also available for download and practice

## Log_Estimation
Using machine learning algorithms and available well data, new well logs (e.g. Facies log, Shear sonic log) will be estimated
I am going to use a sample data set
I will use scikit-learn as my main Python library for machine learning purposes. However, for explatory data analyses and ploting, scientific library ecossystem will be utilized.
I will apply both regression and classification algorithms to estimate a contineous and discrete logs (i.e. Vs (shear wave velocity) and Facies log)
